            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Ali Kansoh </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Beirut, Lebanon.</span>
            <br />
            I've been diving into Java and Node.js for about two years now, and
            it's been quite the journey. Over at Codi Tech, I've been rocking it
            as a full-stack web developer, focusing mainly on the MERN stack.
            <br />
            My academic background includes a bachelor's degree from the
            esteemed Conservatoire National des Arts et des MÃ©tiers (CNAM) in
            Paris, reflecting my commitment to acquiring comprehensive knowledge
            in the field. Mesra.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
